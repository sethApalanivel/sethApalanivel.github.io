# Portfolio — Seth A. Palanivel

This is a static portfolio for analytics/BI work. It uses **GitHub Pages** with the official Actions workflow.

## How to use

1. Create a new **public** repo named: `<your-username>.github.io`.
2. Put these files in the repo (copy everything at the root, including `.github/`).
3. Commit to the `main` branch. The GitHub Actions workflow will publish the site to Pages automatically.
4. Your site will be available at: `https://<your-username>.github.io`.

### Customising

- Replace links in `index.html` (email, LinkedIn, GitHub, resume.pdf).
- Add screenshots to `assets/` and reference them in each `projects/*/index.html`.
- Link the **code repos** and **notebooks** for each case study (use de‑identified or synthetic data).
- Keep metrics honest and label estimates clearly.

### Confidentiality & data
Only use de‑identified/synthetic data. If a dataset can't be shared, include a **model card** and screenshots, not the raw data.

### Optional: Custom domain
Set it under **Settings → Pages** and configure DNS. Enable HTTPS.
